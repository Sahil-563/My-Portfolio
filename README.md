# My Portfolio
## Getting Started with vite+react portfolio app:-

### First Explore the src folder whic contains following folders:-
### 1. route folder:- This folder contains the content which will be changed on the page (Home.js , About.js , Contact.js , Project.js)
### 2. component folder:- This will contain the components of the page such as:- NavBar

## Then we have App.js in which all the components and routes will be imported
### In App.js with the help of `react-router-dom` we will add routes on the routes folder data(means we will add routes for Home,About,Contact,Project) 
### In NavBar component we will add Links for route folder data with the help of `link` module from `react-router-dom`
